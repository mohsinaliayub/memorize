# Memorize
A card matching game for iOS using SwiftUI.

## Game Play
The game is very simple to play:
1. A collection of pairs of emoji cards are displayed face-down.
2. Only two cards can be faced-up at the same time.
3. You face-up one card, then you face-up the second card.
4. If they match, you remove those cards.
5. If they don't match, you face them down again.
6. Repeat step 3 until there are no more matches left.

If user has already seen a pair of cards, but still doesn't successfully match them,
they should be penalized.
